## Features

Implemented features are checked, others are either in-progress or proposals. You can open PR any time and I will try to accept it in next few years :) The hardest job is to find static pointer to value in memory, then you have to experiment with it and try to write new value, then implement logic (+render for some features) in tJocer.
